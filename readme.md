# AI Study Repository

The purpose of this repository is to create different sub projects of artificial inteligence, based on the book "Artificial Intellignece a modern Aproach", some projects will have a graphical interface to make the implementations more easy to visualize.

## Actual sub-projects
* ###  Grid
    Implements a grid interface and make it possible to solve a road to a goal using different types of searching algorithms
* ### Searching
    Implements different Searching algorithms like BFS, DFS
